# Next bigger number with the same digits

You have to create a function that takes a positve integer number formed by the same digits:

```js
nextBigger(12) == 21;
nextBigger(513) == 531;
nextBigger(2017) == 2071;
```

If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

```js
nextBigger(9) == -1;
nextBigger(111) == -1;
nextBigger(531) == -1;
```
